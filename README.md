# Final Project

The goal of our project was to create maps with the shortest paht between Techno-Z and some bars here in Salzburg. These bars and Techno-Z also should have markers with some information. 

To achieve this goal we defined two functions. The first one creates the path and the second one adds markers. Unforunatelly, for some reason our function finds a path which is not necessarily the shortest one. 

The firt and greatest challenge was to install the package osmnx :D Another challenge was to transfer the coordinates into nodes. After that everything went quite smoothly.
